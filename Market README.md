# Big Sale Market Model
# Overview
This project aims to build a predictive model for sales forecasting in the Big Sale Market. The model utilizes historical sales data and various features to predict future sales, enabling better inventory management and strategic decision-making.


# Model Building Process
Data Preprocessing: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling missing values as necessary.

Feature Selection: Select relevant features that have a significant impact on sales prediction.

Model Selection: Evaluate and compare various machine learning algorithms suitable for regression tasks.
Model Training: Train the selected model(s) using the preprocessed data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model(s) using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the selected model(s) to improve performance further.
# Model Deployment
Once the model is trained and evaluated, it can be deployed in a production environment to make real-time predictions. This can be achieved using various deployment platforms such as Flask API, Django, or cloud services like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform.

# Usage
Data Preparation: Prepare new data for prediction following the same preprocessing steps used during model training.

Model Prediction: Use the trained model to predict future sales based on the prepared data.
Performance Monitoring: Monitor the model's performance over time and retrain/update the model as necessary to maintain accuracy.
